## A fun way to learn the countries of the world!

**Geography Learner is a fun, intuitive way to learn the names and capital cities of the countries of the world.** Featuring beautiful normal-mapped topography and a starry backdrop, a copy-pasteable word bank, automatic solving and multiple display modes, Geography Learner is an excellent way to progressively build your knowledge of world geography.<details>
    <summary>Development of Geography Learner was inspired by a trivia question I could not answer: **Where is Mt. Kilimanjaro located?**
    </summary>
    ***Tanzania, of course!***

## Help!
Can't figure out the name of a country? No problem - just hit the "Solve for Me" button. Next time, you might just know it! Once you've solved everything you think you can, reset the game to start from scratch and see how you fare this time - I bet you'll surprise yourself with how much better you do! 

Geography Learner also includes micro-states and small islands which are very difficult to "click" or "tap" on, but have no fear! Using the "Select nearest unsolved" and "Select furthest unsolved" buttons, you can select and solve these relatively tiny countries with ease.

Trying to solve a country and you're **sure** you have the right answer? It may just be a spelling problem! Press and hold the country's name in the Word Bank to copy the exact answer the app expects, then paste it to see if you were truly correct! Note that many countries have a list of names they will accept: for example, *"S Korea"* will work just as well as *"South Korea"* (more alternate names may be added in the future, for ease of use.)
